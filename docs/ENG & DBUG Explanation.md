SYSTEM ENGINES (ENG_)
============================================================
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### ENG_Settings ###
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The Tab, titled "ENG_Settings," maps the `FORM_ID` to the actual `Target_Sheet`.
\>\> It includes the following fields:
  - 1\] **Setting_Key**: A combined key that clearly identifies the form, structured as FORM_MASTER:\[FORM_ID\] // (e.g., FORM_MASTER:FORM_SYS_AddUser, FORM_MASTER:FORM_PRJ_AddTask).
  - 2\] **Setting_Value**: The name of the underlying database table or sheet that the associated form reads from or writes data to (e.g., SYS_Users, HRM_Employees, FIN_DirectExpenses).

\==\> The purpose of this sheet is to link internal view IDs to their user-friendly Arabic titles and their corresponding source data sheets across various system modules (System, HRM, Projects, and Finance).
_______________________________________________
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### ENG_Dropdowns ###
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The Tab, titled "ENG_Dropdowns," serves as a comprehensive master list for all dropdown menu options used throughout an application, providing values in both English and Arabic.
\>\> It includes the following fields:
 - 1\] DD_ID: The unique identifier for a specific type of dropdown list (e.g., DD_Gender, DD_Project_Status, DD_Payment_Method).
 - 2\] DD_EN: The value of the dropdown option in English (e.g., Yes, Male, Active, Completed, Cash).
 - 3\] DD_AR: The value of the dropdown option in Arabic (e.g., نعم, ذكر, نشط, مكتمل, نقدية).
 - 4\] DD_Is_Active: A boolean flag indicating whether the option is currently active (all sample data shows TRUE).
 - 5\] DD_Sort_Order: The numerical order in which the option should appear within its respective dropdown list.
\==\> The purpose of this sheet is to centralize and manage all predefined, multi-lingual selection options for fields such as user status, project statuses, payment methods, expense categories, and job titles within the system.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
### ENG_Buttons ###
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 
The Tab, titled "ENG_Buttons," functions as a master configuration list for all actionable buttons used within the application, linking internal identifiers to user-facing labels and defining their function.
\>\> It includes the following fields:
 - 1\] BTN_ID: The unique internal identifier for the button (e.g., BTN_Reset_Pass, BTN_PRJ_Start).
 - 2\] BTN_Label: The display text for the button, provided in Arabic (e.g., إعادة تعيين كلمة السر, قبول الإجازة).
 - 3\] BTN_Type: Defines where and how the button is used: ROW_ACTION (operates on a single record/row), BULK_ACTION (operates on multiple selected records), or FORM_ACTION (used within a form to submit or change record status).
 - 4\] BTN_Description: A brief description of the button's action or function (e.g., Sends reset email, Changes status to Active, Marks task as Done).
\==\> The purpose of this sheet is to standardize the identification, labeling, and description of all primary action buttons within the system, such as managing users (activate/deactivate), handling requests (approve/reject leave), and updating project or task statuses.

The 3 DBUG Tabs
============================================================
These tabs serve as the system's internal monitoring and diagnostic center. They are separate from the SYS_Audit_Log (which is for business compliance) and focus on technical system health.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7.1 DBUG_AppLog (Application Log)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*Purpose: Records successful system events, routine operations, and general information flow. It answers "What happened?" during normal operation.
*Content: Timestamps, User IDs, Actions (e.g., "LOGIN", "FETCH_DATA"), and context details.
*Usage: Used to trace a user's journey through the app or verify that background processes ran successfully.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7.2 DBUG_WarnLog (Warning Log)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*Purpose: Captures potential issues that didn't crash the system but require attention. It answers "What looks suspicious?"
*Content: Validation failures, unauthorized access attempts (that were blocked), or operations that took longer than expected.
*Usage: Proactive monitoring to prevent future errors. For example, if a user tries to access a restricted form, it might be logged here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7.3 DBUG_ErrorLog (Error Log)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*Purpose: Captures critical failures, crashes, and unhandled exceptions. It answers "What broke?"
*Content: Full error stack traces, error messages, the specific line of code that failed, and the input data that caused the crash.
*Usage: The first place to look when a user reports a bug or a "Something went wrong" message.
==> How They Work
----> Trigger: When code executes (e.g., a user clicks "Save"), the backend functions call specific logging helpers.
----> Processing: The system captures the Actor (who did it), Action (what they did), Entity (what data was touched), and a Timestamp.
----> Storage: This data is formatted into a row and appended to the bottom of the respective Google Sheet tab.
----> Persistence: Since they are just Google Sheets, you can filter, sort, and analyze them using standard spreadsheet tools.
## What's Needed in the Code
To make these tabs functional, three main components are required in your files:
$$ Backend Logic (Code.js)
You need the core logging functions that other parts of the system can call.
logInfo_(actor, action, entity, id, details): Writes to DBUG_AppLog.
logWarn_(actor, action, entity, id, details): Writes to DBUG_WarnLog.
logError_(actor, action, entity, id, message, errorObject): Writes to DBUG_ErrorLog.
appendDebugRow(sheetName, dataObj): A helper function that handles the actual writing to the spreadsheet.
$$ Integration Points (Throughout Code.js)
You must sprinkle these log calls throughout your business logic.
Example: Inside a saveEmployee function:
try {
   // ... saving logic ...
   logInfo_(user.id, "SAVE", "EMPLOYEE", empId, "Successfully saved");
} catch (e) {
   logError_(user.id, "SAVE_try {
   // ... saving logic ...
   logInfo_(user.id, "SAVE", "EMPLOYEE", empId, "Successfully saved");
} catch (e) {
   logError_(user.id, "SAVE_
